# Usage
Simply run the script in a folder containing .mkv files (support for setting a specific folder coming soon) and it will run.
If you want to add/change the selected languages, just add/remove them from the `langs` variable at the top of the script.

# Dependencies
ffmpeg. That's it (unless your distro is missing jq).
